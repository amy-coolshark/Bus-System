# Bus-System
## A bus management system based on Vancouver Bus System data

This program reads in given files and gives user options on what they can do with the given data.

The given options include:
* Finding the shortest path between 2 bus stops
* Searching for the name of a bus stop
* Searching for a trip given the arrival time
* Shutting down the program

Once the program is started, the data is read and processed and a welcome message 
is shown, giving the user the options listed above to choose from. Error checking is
used to make sure the option inputted by the user is valid.

Unfortunately, due to time constraints and clashes between other modules, some 
functionality of the program is not fully implemented, however the basic functionality
is there.
